# DevChat
> This is a simple chat application that I made


## Quick Note
This is something I made at the beginning of 2025 and then completely forgot about however I have now made the code public for others to use however I do plan on updating this eventually as it is a fully functioning application that is just missing a lot of features.


## Todo

- [ ] Add message editing and deleting
- [ ] Add profile/account settings
- [ ] Implement account recovery methods

# Introduction
A lightweight, modern chat application built with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and a clean client/server architecture. Originally created on Replit as a learning project, DevChat has grown into a flexible foundation for real‑time messaging features, user accounts, and more.

This repository is structured for clarity, scalability, and ease of development — making it a great starting point for future enhancements.
